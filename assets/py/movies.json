        "plot_outline": "Mr. Pearson's days in front of the camera may be a thing of the past, but the actor inside of him is very much alive. Caroline and Miguel split days and nights with legendary Hollywood actor Robert Pearson, a brilliant and talented gentleman battling mental decline. Despite their differences in approach to caring for the cantankerous man, both have the same goal of keeping him safe and connected. Miguel's care-taking method is pretty straightforward as he spends most of his time with Mr. Pearson meeting his basic needs of eating, sleeping, and grooming. Caroline, on the other hand, has become more than a nurse. A maternal confidante and playful companion, Caroline stops at nothing to keep Mr. Pearson from slipping away, even if that means casting herself opposite the leading man to perform a scene from one of his hit movies from long ago. And it's working. Their make-believe games cause Mr. Pearson to feel alive again, but as the line between fantasy and reality blurs, his grip loosens and Caroline's gets tighter. Now, with everyone's livelihood on the line, Miguel and Caroline must work together to save Mr. Pearson's luminous star from fading to black.",

We know it well: after the first glass of wine, the conversation lifts, the possibilities open up. Martin (Mads Mikkelsen) is a high-school teacher who feels old and tired. His students and their parents want him terminated to increase their average. Encouraged by the per mille theory, Martin and his three colleagues throw themselves into an experiment to maintain a constant alcohol impact in everyday life. If Churchill won World War II in a dense fog of spirits, what could the strong drops do for them and their students? The result is positive in the beginning. Martin's class is in a different way now, and the project is being promoted to a real academic study with the collection of results. Slowly but surely, the alcohol makes the four friends and their surroundings loosen up. The results are rising, and they really begin to feel life. As the objects go inboard, the experiment progresses for some and goes off track for others. It becomes clearer and clearer that alcohol can generate great results in world history, but that all daring can also have consequences. The film is described as a fun, touching and thought-provoking drama about friendship, freedom--and alcohol.",

Romy doesn't like having to go to the hairdressing salon every day, but this changes when grandma Stine confides in her granddaughter, telling her about her increasing confusion.

        "plot_outline": "\"November\" is based on Estonian novel \"Rehepapp\" by Andrus Kivir\u00e4hk, a bestseller of the last twenty years. The film is a mixture of magic, black humor and romantic love. The story is set in a pagan Estonian village where werewolves, the plague, and spirits roam. The villagers' main problem is how to survive the cold, dark winter. And, to that aim, nothing is taboo. People steal from each other, from their German manor lords, and from spirits, the devil, and Christ. To guard their souls, they'll give them away to thieving creatures made of wood and metal called kratts, who help their masters by stealing more. They steal even if their barns are already overflowing. Stealing is an obsession that makes the villagers more and more like the soulless creatures they command, the kratts. The main character of the film is a young farm girl named Liina who is hopelessly and forlornly in love with a village boy named Hans. Her longing makes the girl become a werewolf and jump into an ice-cold pond. She's ready to die in the name of love. The pragmatic farmers are faced with a question: is the life that they've won through so much toil worth anything, if it lacks a soul? Estonian pagan and European Christian mythologies come together in this film. Both mythologies look for a miracle; for an ancient force that gives one a soul. This film is about souls - longing for a soul, selling your soul, and living without a soul.",

Ela is a young woman seeking refuge from the insipidness of a life hallowed by the regime, mixing with artists on the alternative scene, singing in clubs with her post-punk band, and attending alcohol-fuelled parties... In her second film director Olga Chajdas summons up vital energy to invigorate the music scene of the Baltic Tricity and, aided by the charismatic actress and co-scripter Lena G\u00f3ra, she offers the viewer a vivid portrait of a multilayered character - an inspirational artist forever enveloped in cigarette smoke, a woman struggling with her inner demons, yet also a fragile creature yearning for motherly love.",
