In order to crack the case, the siblings set out on a quest for clues, leading them on an epic and suspenseful family adventure, including boat racing through canals, exploring secret tunnels and uncovering lost treasures.

Hunter Street stars Stony Blyden as street-smart Max; MaeMae Renfrow as the independent and resourceful sister Tess; Kyra Smith as the free-spirited youngest Hunter sister Anika; Daan Creyghton as Sal, the genius of the bunch; and Thomas Jansen as the fiercely protective eldest brother Daniel.
