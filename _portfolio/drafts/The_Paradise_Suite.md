The Paradise Suite is about six people finding one another and, sometimes with just one glance, influencing one another's lives irreversibly. Beautiful young Bulgarian Jenya's journey to Amsterdam turns out to be the opposite of what she hoped for. Her grueling captivity forces angelic African Yaya to fight for her freedom--a dangerous fight in which he loses everything but his beloved faith. Serbian war criminal Ivica, who has just become a father, is painfully confronted with the fact that crimes will never go unpunished. Bosnian Seka has nothing left to live for except her vengeance, but that same vengeance brings love back into her life. And when Swedish piano wonder-boy Lukas runs away from his new temporary home, his father Stig finally realizes that their mutual passion for music damages their relationship.
