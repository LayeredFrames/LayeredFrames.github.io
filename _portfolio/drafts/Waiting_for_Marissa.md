The film tells the story about two eleven-year-old boys who do not know each other; they meet under a tree in a deserted landscape where they both have an appointment with the same girl. While waiting for her, the two boys get intertwined in a struggle over power and a game of attraction and rejection regarding the girl. Uncertain if the girl will show up, the two boys form, despite their differences, the basis of a friendship.
