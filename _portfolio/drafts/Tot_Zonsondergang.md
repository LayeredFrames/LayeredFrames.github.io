Smart schoolboy Harvey keeps a cool head while elder kids physically intimidate him and his mates in the local wood, during their last summer holiday before joining high-school. Having escaped after turning a bully's abusive prank against her, the other kids blame Tim's disappearance either on that gang, or the lady in the 'haunted house'. Both turn out innocent, Tim scared away from telling his secret, and isn't alone having one.
