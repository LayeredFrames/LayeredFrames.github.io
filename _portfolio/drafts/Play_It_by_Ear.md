Lukas, originally from the Netherlands, and Mila, born and raised in California, are college sweethearts planning on moving in together after graduation. But when their careers force them to stay apart, they resolve to rise to the challenge of a long-distance relationship. Mila is accepted into a yearlong screenwriters program in Los Angeles, and Lukas moves across the world to work for a magazine in Amsterdam. For one year, they'll try to make things work -- but cracks in their bond appear sooner than expected.
