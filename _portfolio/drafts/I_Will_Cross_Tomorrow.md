Maria is a Greek policewoman, struggling with her money problems, teenage daughter, old mother and the crisis in her country, that affects her professionally. Yussof is a Syrian rebel, on his way out of a war-ridden Syria to go to Europe. Both have killed unwontedly, both feel guilty, but together, they will find some inner peace.
