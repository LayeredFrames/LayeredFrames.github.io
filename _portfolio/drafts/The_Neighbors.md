Peter and Eva, a nice young couple expecting their first child, buy a house in a suburban village. Before they get to move into their new home, they lose the baby girl. Eva has a hard time coping with her loss. Peter has mixed feelings. The baby wasn't his to begin with. He's infertile and hopes the chapter of having children has now come to an end. When they meet their new neighbors Rebecca and Steven, a carefree outgoing couple, that helps them forget their pain. But are Rebecca and Steven really who they say they are?
