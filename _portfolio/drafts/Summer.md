Set over the course of one sweltering summer, this charming drama focuses on Anna, a quiet teen who yearns to escape the confines of her small town, defined by its ever-looming power plant. With the arrival of the alluring leather-clad Lena, Anna finally gets the boost she needs. With authentic performances and cinematography that captures the languor and heat of summertime, this story of sexual awakening examines a girl daring to be different.
