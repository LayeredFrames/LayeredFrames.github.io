In 'Gek van Geluk', Plien van Bennekom steps into the role of single mum Lena, who writes love songs but is stumped with writer's block because she has no romance in her life. Her best friend Valerie (Carly Wijs), a singer, comes up with a solution: she hires an unemployed actor to turn Lena's head and kickstart her inspiration. Lena falls head over heels for the handsome Hugo (Matteo van der Grijn) and it appears the plan has worked--until Lena becomes so distracted by the butterflies in her stomach that a new hit single is the last thing on her mind. In a desperate attempt to get Lena writing again Valerie puts their year-long friendship on the line and confronts Lena with the truth.
