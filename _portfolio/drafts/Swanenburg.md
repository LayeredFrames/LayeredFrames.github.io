When patriarch Jack Praal is confronted with his biggest fear and his youngest son Dirk is linked to a woman's death, the family gets trapped in a web of intrigue and betrayal. During the course of five weeks, the series follows the family members, who put their own interests aside in order to save everything. But not everyone is playing a fair game, which seems to result in the inevitable downfall of the once-close Praal family.
