In a car shop in Rotterdam, three car mechanics find out that the owner of the car shop, their colleague and boss, has a debt of EUR40.000 with the tax service. After unsuccessfully trying several possible solutions, these four beer-drinking and cigarette-smoking out-of-shape men ask their fifth colleague, a now physically disabled but former marathon runner, to train them for a marathon. If they finish it, their debt will be paid, if they don't, they lose the garage.
