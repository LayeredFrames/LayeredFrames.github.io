Kenza, young and headstrong, lives on a junkyard in the countryside of Curaçao with her father, Ouira, and grand- father, Weljo. The two men are true polar opposites: Ouira is a determined, rational police officer, while Weljo identifies with the island's spirituality and native inhabitants. As Weljo wishes to prepare his passing to the world of spirits, the relationship between Ouira and Weljo starts to escalate and eleven-year-old Kenza searches for her own path between the two extremes. The down-to-earth mentality of Ouira no longer offers her all that she needs and, slowly, she opens up to the more mystical and comforting traditions of her grandfather.
