Based on a true story, A Beautiful Imperfection tells the empowering tale of Lucia, Giacomo Casanova's first and greatest love, who leaves Italy for Amsterdam, after her face has been disfigured by smallpox. Sixteen years later, when she has reinvented herself as a veiled courtesan known by the name of Galath√©e, they meet again. Without revealing her true identity and face, Lucia and Giacomo become lovers once more. Does Lucia dare to unveil herself and turn her weakness into her strength so she can be truly free in the face of her great love?
