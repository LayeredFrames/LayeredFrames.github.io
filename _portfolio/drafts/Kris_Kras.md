Jurre and Kiki twins of nine years old. With divorced, working parents, they only have one real home: Grandpa's house. Until their mother decides to move to Ibiza together with them. If their grandfather gets an accident, nobody can take care of him and his house is put up for sale, the children make a decision: they are going to take care of him. That means; back to the Netherlands. What follows is a journey criss-cross through Europe. Without money, without speaking the language of the countries where they end up, but determined. They meet special people, experience the wildest, exciting and funny adventures and get to know each other better and better. But are the children on time to stop the sale?
