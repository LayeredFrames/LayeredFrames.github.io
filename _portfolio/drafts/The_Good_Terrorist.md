In The Good Terrorist, renowned filmmaker Robert Oey investigates the world of Muslim terrorism and questions the attitude of the West, concerning its own homegrown terrorism. As young men, Jason Walters and Nouredine El Fahtni are members of the extremist Dutch Hofstadgroep, a group held responsible for murder, plotting terror attacks and making death threats. Now, they claim to be reformed. They warn against radicalization. Or proclaim to be family men. But what goes on inside the head of a convicted terrorist? Is there such a thing as a good terrorist?
