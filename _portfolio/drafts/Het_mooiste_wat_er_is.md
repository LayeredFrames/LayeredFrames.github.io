Sam and Do are struggling with love in this story. They are together for five years, enjoying their lives and being more than happy. Although they are opposites, they complement each other perfectly and bring up the best in each other. But when Do gives birth to their son Max, their world is turned upside down. Doubt, different views on parenting and unfinished things from the past cause a growing rift in their relationship. Will love survive after the arrival of their baby?
