Surrounded by endless horizons we wander the sands together with gold seeker Salomon (60), whose Jewish appearance is almost a caricature. He cheerfully whistles along with the Klezmer song on his portable radio, while his detector sweeps the wet sand. Then his detector goes off, and Salomon finds himself face to face with a rusty periscope sticking out of the sand. His astonishment grows as the periscope starts to follow his movements. When a pounding noise is being produced from the hold under the ground Salomon decides to grab his spade and save this strange form of life before the tide will turn. Finally, he discovers the hatch of what seems to be a giant submarine and opens it. He is in for the shock of his life when he finds he has just released its fanatical German crew who have long passed the age of retirement...
