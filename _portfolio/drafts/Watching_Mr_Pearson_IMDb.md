Mr. Pearson's days in front of the camera may be a thing of the past, but the actor inside of him is very much alive. Caroline and Miguel split days and nights with legendary Hollywood actor Robert Pearson, a brilliant and talented gentleman battling mental decline. Despite their differences in approach to caring for the cantankerous man, both have the same goal of keeping him safe and connected. Miguel's care-taking method is pretty straightforward as he spends most of his time with Mr. Pearson meeting his basic needs of eating, sleeping, and grooming. Caroline, on the other hand, has become more than a nurse. A maternal confidante and playful companion, Caroline stops at nothing to keep Mr. Pearson from slipping away, even if that means casting herself opposite the leading man to perform a scene from one of his hit movies from long ago. And it's working. Their make-believe games cause Mr. Pearson to feel alive again, but as the line between fantasy and reality blurs, his grip loosens and Caroline's gets tighter. Now, with everyone's livelihood on the line, Miguel and Caroline must work together to save Mr. Pearson's luminous star from fading to black.
