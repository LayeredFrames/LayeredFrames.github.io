Amsterdam surgeon Martinus Elsenbosch succeeds the old, popular only GP in country village Wourkem, where his aunt Jannie lives. The locals are as stubborn in their largely-outdated ways as snobbish wise-guy Martinus, whom they re-dub Tinus, is in upholding his status and proclaiming doctor's orders, which are often ignored, worst of all by the grossly-incompetent, irreverent assistant Kim, whom he 'inherits' with the practice. Naive sole constable Ken tries to mediate, and foxy teacher Lisa de Graaf is attracted to the intellectual but turned off by his insensitive side.
